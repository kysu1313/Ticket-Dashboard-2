# Ticket-Dashboard

This is a personal project I created to help improve the workflow in the repair cernter I work at. We do Mac and PC repairs and have devices checked in using a ticket system. This display is shown on a large TV in the service room. It shows the technicians what repairs are coming up next, when we get contacted by a customer, and when a ticket has been sitting for too long. Since implementing this we've seen an increase in repair processing time. The site requires authorization to use but these are a few images of it.


 - Bright colors were used to help with visibility and quick identification of different ticket status types.
 - This layout groups the tickets by their status. The ordering of the statuses is customizable as well as the number of tickets to show per status.
 - Inside each status group the tickets are grouped by their arrival time with the oldest tickets at the front.
 - You can also configure which statuses you want to display.

 - This layout displays all tickets in the order at which they were created with the oldest tickets first.
 - The older the ticket, the higher priority it gets.

 - The repair shop I work at has two locations. On the site you can switch between them.
